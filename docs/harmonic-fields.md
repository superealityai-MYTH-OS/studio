# Harmonic Fields — Concept Notes

## Purpose
Represent semantic similarity not as geometric distance, but as energetic resonance across conceptual space.

## Why
Traditional approaches (cosine similarity, dot product) flatten meaning to vectors.
Harmonic fields preserve:
- tension
- cohesion
- divergence
- phase coherence

## Direction
Eventually supports:
- semantic clusters
- resonance tolerances
- interference patterns
