### Define Resonance Tolerances

**Goal:**  
Establish numeric or symbolic thresholds for what constitutes:

- high match  
- borderline resonance  
- no meaningful similarity  

**Open Questions:**  
- Where should harmonic collapse occur?  
- Should we support fuzzy grouping?  
- Should resonance scores degrade over time?  

**Outcome:**  
Shared assumptions → code consistency.  

**Type:** Discussion → Spec
